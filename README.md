 ### 🤓 · About me: [LinkedIn 🤝](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccnick/)
I went back to school in my late twenties after about eight years in the finance industry. I majored in Aerospace Engineering @ Iowa State University because of my love for flight vehicles both above and below the Karman line. My first two semesters, while working full-time, I was introduced to programming specifically for aerospace applications. The rest is history, I switched majors to Software Engineering that same semester. I've been working as a Software Engineering Intern @ John Deere since July 2022.
