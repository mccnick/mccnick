 ### 🤓 Welcome! I'm Nick:
🖳 software engineering student | 🚀 aerospace enthusiast | 🎵 music enjoyer | 🐶 dog lover | 🎮 gamer 

(<- and that's Ollie 🐶)

 ### 😎 About me: 
I went back to school in my late twenties after about eight years in the finance industry. I majored in Aerospace Engineering @ Iowa State University because of my love for flight vehicles both above and below the Karman line. My first two semesters I was introduced to programming specifically for aerospace applications. The rest is history, I switched majors to Software Engineering that same semester.

 ### 🌱 I am currently working on: 
- Learning Data Structures and Algorithms, both in class and on my own
- Developing my own 3D outer space portfolio inspired by three.JS
- Building an app to help Iowa State students
- Contributing to open source projects
