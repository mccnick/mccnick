### Hello, welcome to my GitHub! 💁🏻‍♂️

### I'm Nick. I am a:
- software engineering student 🖳
- space enthusiast 🚀
- music enjoyer 🎵
- dog lover 🐶
- gamer 🎮

### About me:
I went back to school in my late twenties after about eight years in the finance industry. I majored in Aerospace Engineering @ Iowa State University because of my love for flight vehicles both above and below the Karman line. My first two semesters I was introduced to programming specifically for Aerospace applications. I designed a Python program using real physics for a SpaceX rocket to fly around a 2D Earth. My second semester I made an interactive program for an aircraft weight, balance and density altitude calculator. The rest is history, I switched majors to software engineering that same semester.

🌱 ### I am currently working on:
- Learning Data Structures and Algorithms, both in class and on my own
- Developing my own 3D website portfolio inspired by three.JS
- Building my first app
-
