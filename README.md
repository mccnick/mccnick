### Hi there 👋
### I'm Nick. I am a:
- software engineering student 
- space enthusiast
- music enjoyer
- dog lover
- gamer

### About me:
I went back to school in my late twenties after about eight years in the finance industry. I majored in Aerospace Engineering @ Iowa State University because of my love for flight vehicles both above and below the Karman line. My first two semesters I was introduced to programming specifically for Aerospace applications. I designed a Python program using real physics for a SpaceX rocket to fly around a 2D Earth. My second semester I made an interactive program for an aircraft weight, balance and density altitude calculator. The rest is history. I switched majors to software engineering that same semester.
