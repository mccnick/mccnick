 ### 🤓 · About me / <sub>*Storytime*</sub>
>I went back to school in my late twenties after about eight years in the finance industry (Toyota & Wells Fargo). I majored in Aerospace Engineering @ Iowa State University because of my love for flight vehicles both above and below the Karman line. My first two semesters, [while working full-time](https://www.registrar.iastate.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/info/DeansListF21Updated418.pdf "Dean's List"), I was introduced to programming specifically for aerospace applications. The rest is history, I switched majors to Software Engineering that same semester. I'm currently a SWE Intern @ John Deere.
